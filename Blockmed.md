# Blockchain

## 9/17/2018 Questions

What is the scope of this project?
Create a Blockchain that will readable and writable prescription data.

What is the goal of this project (who will be using it, how will they be using it)?
Users: patients (read), pharmacists (read), drug regulationists (read), doctors (write); 

What tools will we be permitted to use/can we expect funding from our sponsor to use certain software development tools?
GitHub - there is a student free edition for Private repos;
BYOD - bring your own device for developing
Final product - I don't anticipate any software or hardware costs as our final product will be a decentralized ledger which ideally would exist on multiple devices.  

Xavier will contribute cash as sponsor on a case by case basis.  

How involved will you be with the project? If so, what kind of work can we expect from you? (technical contributions, management, etc.)
Xavier will serve as Product Manager, in other words:
	1) as a support role to find technical advisers that can help our team learn and
	2) as a manager defining our finished product

Which smart contract framework should we use? The details for this are listed below.
This is up to the student team as you will work with and know the technology best on a developer level.  

	Other Questions:
What kind of documentation do you expect us to implement?
An explanation of how our product works and the components; think of our product as a pie we baked and now we want to share the recipe.  
My expectation is you do this as a Word doc, powerpoint, website, whatever you think best gets your message across.  

What are your upgrade, update, and post-development support needs for this project?
The scope of this project is to deploy the final product we discussed, I wouldn't worry about next steps.  However, next steps would include scalability and adoption in real-life situation.  

Are there any problems you foresee as of right now?
Yes, please see list below in order of highest to lowest likelihood of facing.  
	1) Scope Creep - With a mulit-faceted project (UI, D-apps, networks, etc.) it's easy to dream more features but we want to focus on the task at hand.  
	2) Presenting Our Product Concisely and Directly - Blockchain is a buzzword everyone has heard of and yet it's a difficult concept to explain.  At the end of this project every single member of our team will be able to pitch our idea.  (Sponsor will help construct Elevator Pitch and Pitch Deck).
